This directory contains the neural network potential (NNP) files used in the manuscript, “Theory of History-Dependent Multi-Layer Generalized Stacking Fault Energy: A Modeling of the Micro-Substructure Evolution Kinetics in Chemically Ordered Medium-Entropy Alloys”, by Peijun Yu, Jun-Ping Du, Shuhei Shinzato, Fanshun Meng and Shigenobu Ogata. Acta Materialia, 224 (2021): 117504.


1. “nnp-version1.pdf”  contains the details of the construction of the NNP for CrCoNi.
2. “input.nn”, “scaling.data”, “weights.024.data”, “weights.027.data” and “weights.028.data” are the potential files that can be used with LAMMPS and the NNP interface in the n2p2 code (https://compphysvienna.github.io/n2p2/). The cflength and cfenergy keywords need to be set to 1.0.
