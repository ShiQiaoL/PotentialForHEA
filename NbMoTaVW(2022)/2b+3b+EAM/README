Mo-Nb-Ta-V-W.tabgap and Mo-Nb-Ta-V-W.eam.fs are the potential files needed
to run simulations for alloys.

First, compile lammps with the tabgap pair_style from https://gitlab.com/jezper/tabgap


Below are the relevant lammps input lines, assuming all 5 elements in the simulation.
(place the potential files somewhere convenient and replace /path/to/...)
-------------------------
mass 1 95.95
mass 2 92.90637
mass 3 180.94788
mass 4 50.9415
mass 5 183.84
pair_style hybrid/overlay eam/fs tabgap
pair_coeff * * eam/fs /path/to/Mo-Nb-Ta-V-W.eam.fs Mo Nb Ta V W
pair_coeff * * tabgap /path/to/Mo-Nb-Ta-V-W.tabgap Mo Nb Ta V W no yes
-------------------------


The pure-* folders contain potential files tabulated only for the pure metals,
which can only be used when simulating the pure metals. These potentials are
exactly the same as the pure-metal parts of the full Mo-Nb-Ta-V-W potential files.
The only reason for including them here is that the Mo-Nb-Ta-V-W.tabgap file is quite
big and takes some seconds for lammps to read in, so that when doing very short
static or MD simulations for pure metals, it is a lot faster to use the much
smaller potential files from the pure-* folders.
NOTE, however, that if you are only interested in the pure metals, I do not recommend
using this potential! Only if you want to e.g. directly compare the pure metal to some
alloy. Because if you only care about one of the pure metals, although the potential
should give OK results, it's better to use a potential that is specifically fitted for
the metal and has been well-tested (this potential is mostly tested for alloys).
