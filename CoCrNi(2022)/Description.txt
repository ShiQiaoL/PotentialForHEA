1. This directory contains the neural network potential (NNP) files used in the manuscript, “Chemical domain structure and its formation kinetics in CrCoNi medium-entropy alloy”, Acta Materialia, 240 (2022): 118314, by Jun-Ping Du, Peijun Yu, Shuhei Shinzato, Fanshun Meng, Yuji Sato, Yangen Li, Yiwen Fan and Shigenobu Ogata.


2. “nnp-version2.pdf”  contains the details of the construction of the NNP for CrCoNi.
“input.nn”, “scaling.data”, “weights.024.data”, “weights.027.data” and “weights.028.data” are the potential files that can be used with LAMMPS and the NNP interface in the n2p2 code(https://compphysvienna.github.io/n2p2/). The cflength and cfenergy keywords need to be set to 1.0.
